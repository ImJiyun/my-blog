### Why TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Catches type-related errors during development.
- **Prevents Runtime Errors**: Many bugs are caught before the code even runs.
- **Strongly Typed Language**: Enforces strict typing rules.
- **Compilation Process**:
  - TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript, which browsers can understand.
  - Compilation fails if there are any type errors.
- **Early Protection**: Errors are caught at compile time.
- **Type Inference**: TS can automatically guess variable types.

### Implicit Types vs Explicit Types

TypeScript automatically infers the type based on the value assigned:

```TypeScript
let message = "hello";
message = "bye";
// message = 1; // error
```

We can also explicitly define the type:

```TypeScript
let isLoggedIn : boolean = "no"; // error
```

## any, never, void, unknown

### any

- Disables type checking
- We lose type protection from TypeScript

```TypeScript
const a : any[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const b : any : true
a + b // valid
```

- do not use `any` as much as possible

### never

- It's a type for a function that never returns
  - throws an error or has an infinite loop

### void

- use for functions that doesn't return anything

```TypeScript
function sayHi(): void {
  console.log("Hi!");
}

```

### unknown

- When we don't know the type of a variable, we use `unknown`
- We get protection from Type checker
  - We need to check the type with `typeof`

```TypeScript
let num1 : unknown;

let num2 = num1 + 1; // won't work
```

```TypeScript
let var1 : unknown;

if (typeof var1 === "number") {
  let var2 = var1 + 1; // it works!
}

if (typeof var1 === "string") {
  let var3 = var1.toLowerCase(); // it works!
}
```
