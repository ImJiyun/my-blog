## React Essentials

### Component

- React apps are about combining components
- Any website or app can be broken down into smaller building blocks : components
- Components can potentially be reused.

#### Why components?

1. Reusable building blocks
   - Create small building blocks & compose the UI from them
   - If needed : Reuse a building block in different parts of the UI
2. Related code lives together
   - Related HTML & JS (and possibly CSS) code is stored together
   - Since JS influences the output, storing JS + HTML together makes sense.
3. Separation of concerns
   - Different components handle different data & logic
   - Vastly simplifies the process of working on complex apps

#### Two Rules

1. Name starts with uppercase character
   - The function name must start with an uppercase character
   - Multi-word names should be written in PascalCase (MyHeader)
   - It's recommended to pick a name that describes the UI building block (e.g. Header or MyHeader)
2. Returns "Renderable" content
   - The function must return a value that can be rendered by React
   - In most cases : return JSX
   - Also allowed : string, number, boolean, null, array of allowed values

### JSX

- JavaScript Syntax eXtension
- used to describe & create HTML elements in JS in a "declarative" way
- With React, we write "Declarative code"
- We define the target HTML structure & UI - not the steps to get there!
- But browser doesn't support JSX
- React projects come with a build process that transform JSX code (behind the scenes) to code that does work in browsers

### How components get rendered

`index.jsx`

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
// ReactDom is responsible for outputting the App component's content on the screen

import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";

// index.jsx file acts as the main entry point of React app
// since it's the first file to be loaded by index.html file
const entryPoint = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.createRoot(entryPoint).render(<App />);
// render method is called on an object created with createRoot method
// createRoot takes an existing HTML element as an input
// render method renders component and its nested components into html element
```

- Component Tree : a hierarchy of components. analyzed & rendered by React step by step
- Custom components don't show up in the actual rendered DOM

### Built-in vs Custom components

- Bulit-in components
  - Name starts with a lowercase character
  - Only valid, officially defined HTML elements are allowed
  - Are rendered as DOM nodes by React
- Custom components
  - Name starts with uppercase character
  - Defined by devs, "wraps" built-in or other custom components
  - React "traverses" the component tree until it has only built-in components left

### Outputting Dynamic Content in JSX

- Static content
  - content that's hardcoded into the JSX code
  - can't change at runtime
- Dynamic content
  - Logic that produces the actual value is added to JSX
  - content / value is derived at runtime

### React Projects & "The build process"

- React projects must be "built" (via a build project) before deployment
- React code : dev writes & test
- Build process :
  - changes & optimizes your code
  - transforms it such that it runs in the browser
  - also (potentially) optimizes other assets like CSS & image files
- Deployable files :
  - a collection of generated files that includes your optimized code and any other extra assets (e.g. css code files, optimized images etc)

### Configuring components with "props"

- React allow us to pass data to components via a concept called "props"
- JSX code that uses a component set component input data via "custom HTML attributes" (props)
- component defines internal logic + JSX code that should be rendered
- component function receives props parameter with configuration data
- props accept all value types
  - String values are passed with quotes
  - Number value : curly braces are required to pass the value as a number. If quotes were used, it would be considered a string
  - Object value :
    - this is no special "double curly braces" syntax
    - It's simply a JS object passed as a value
- The value that will be passed for this parameter to component by React will be an object that has key-value pairs (keys are custom attributes, values are the attribute values)
- props are "custom HTML attributes" set on components
- React merges all props into a single object
- Props are passed to the component function as the first argument by React

```jsx
function CoreConcept(props) {
  return (
    <li>
      <img src={props.image} alt="" />
      <h3>{props.tilte}</h3>
      <p>{props.description} </p>
    </li>
  );
}
```

- or using object desctructuring

```jsx
function CoreConcept({ image, title, description }) {
  return (
    <li>
      <img src={image} alt="" />
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{description} </p>
    </li>
  );
}
```

### children props

- React will give a props object even if component doesn't get props set on component
- a prop set by React and not set with help of attributes
- refers to the content between component opening and closing tags
- React automatically passes a sepecial prop named "children" to every custom component
- its name must be "children"

#### children prop vs attribute prop

- children prop
  - for components that take a single piece of renderable content, this approach it closer to "normal HTML usage"
  - This approach is espeically convenient when passing JSX code as a value to another component
- attribute prop
  - This approach makes sense if we got. multiple smaller pieces of information that must be passed to a component
  - Adding extra props instead of just wrapping the content with the component tags mean extra work

### React events

```jsx
export default function TapButton({ children }) {
  function handleClick() {}
  return (
    <li>
      {/* values for event prop is a function */}
      {/* that should be executed when that event occurs */}
      {/* we must not add parentheses instead use name of the function */}
      {/* we want to use the function as value */}
      {/* it should be executed by React when a click on this button occurs in the future */}
      {/* with parenthese, this function gets executed when this line gets executed */}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>{children}</button>
    </li>
  );
}
```

### Passing custom arguments to event function

```jsx
// with default export, import it without curly braces
import CoreConcept from "./components/CoreConcept";
import Header from "./components/Header/Header.jsx";
import TapButton from "./components/TapButton.jsx";
import { CORE_CONCEPTS } from "./data";

function App() {
  function handleSelect(selectedButton) {
    console.log(selectedButton);
  }

  // jsx - JS file that uses non-standard JS syntax

  return (
    // html code inside JavaScript
    <div>
      {/* we can use component like HTML element */}
      <Header />
      <main>
        <section id="core-concepts">
          <h2>Time to get started!</h2>
          <ul>
            <CoreConcept
              title={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].title}
              description={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].description}
              image={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].image}
            />

            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[1]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[2]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[3]} />
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="examples">
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <menu>
            {/* arrow function is the value passed as a value to onSelect, also to onClick in TapButton.jsx*/}
            {/* this function will be executed when the button is clicked */}
            {/* now we can control how it will be executed */}
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("components")}>
              Components
            </TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("jsx")}>JSX</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("props")}>Props</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("state")}>State</TapButton>
          </menu>
        </section>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Behind the scene of React

- By default, react components execute ONLY once
- We have to "tell" React if a component should be executed again
- React compares the old output ("old JSX code") of component function to the new output("new JSX code") and applies any differences to the actual website UI

```jsx
// with default export, import it without curly braces

import CoreConcept from "./components/CoreConcept";
import Header from "./components/Header/Header.jsx";
import TapButton from "./components/TapButton.jsx";
import { CORE_CONCEPTS } from "./data";

function App() {
  let tabContent = "Please click a button";

  function handleSelect(selectedButton) {
    tabContent = selectedButton;
  }

  // jsx - JS file that uses non-standard JS syntax

  console.log("APP COMPONENT EXECUTING");
  return (
    // html code inside JavaScript
    <div>
      {/* we can use component like HTML element */}
      <Header />
      <main>
        <section id="core-concepts">
          <h2>Time to get started!</h2>
          <ul>
            <CoreConcept
              title={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].title}
              description={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].description}
              image={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].image}
            />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[1]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[2]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[3]} />
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="examples">
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <menu>
            {/* arrow function is the value passed as a value to onSelect, also to onClick in TapButton.jsx*/}
            {/* this function will be executed when the button is clicked */}
            {/* now we can control how it will be executed */}
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("components")}>
              Components
            </TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("jsx")}>JSX</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("props")}>Props</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("state")}>State</TapButton>
          </menu>
          {tabContent}
        </section>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- this App component is not re-rendered -> the UI is not updated -> the concept of state appeared.
- we can't use a regular variable for updating UI

### React hooks & useState

- state is all about registering variables
- React hooks are regular functions
- They must be called inside React component functions, top level of component function
- Rules of Hooks
  - Only call hooks inside of component functions
  - Only call hooks on the top level - not be called in nested code statements (e.g. inside of if-statements)
- useState - helps us to manage component specific state, data stored by React
- when state is changed, it will trigger component function to re-execute.
- takes an argument, initial value,
- returns an array with two elements,
  - current data snapshot for that component execution cycle, may change if the component function is executed again
  - state updating function : updates the stored value & "tells" React to re-execute the component function in which useState() was called

```jsx
// with default export, import it without curly braces

import { useState } from "react";
import CoreConcept from "./components/CoreConcept";
import Header from "./components/Header/Header.jsx";
import TapButton from "./components/TapButton.jsx";
import { CORE_CONCEPTS } from "./data";

function App() {
  const [selectedTopic, setSelectedTopic] = useState("Please click a button");

  function handleSelect(selectedButton) {
    setSelectedTopic(selectedButton);
    console.log(selectedTopic); // current state, not updated state value
  }

  // jsx - JS file that uses non-standard JS syntax

  console.log("APP COMPONENT EXECUTING");

  return (
    // html code inside JavaScript
    <div>
      {/* we can use component like HTML element */}
      <Header />
      <main>
        <section id="core-concepts">
          <h2>Time to get started!</h2>
          <ul>
            <CoreConcept
              title={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].title}
              description={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].description}
              image={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].image}
            />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[1]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[2]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[3]} />
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="examples">
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <menu>
            {/* arrow function is the value passed as a value to onSelect, also to onClick in TapButton.jsx*/}
            {/* this function will be executed when the button is clicked */}
            {/* now we can control how it will be executed */}
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("components")}>
              Components
            </TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("jsx")}>JSX</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("props")}>Props</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("state")}>State</TapButton>
          </menu>
          {selectedTopic}
        </section>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- React schedules state update and it then re-executes this component function.
- the updated value will only be available after this app component function executed again.

### Rendering content conditionally

```jsx
// with default export, import it without curly braces
import { useState } from "react";
import CoreConcept from "./components/CoreConcept";
import Header from "./components/Header/Header.jsx";
import TapButton from "./components/TapButton.jsx";
import { CORE_CONCEPTS } from "./data";
import { EXAMPLES } from "./data";

function App() {
  const [selectedTopic, setSelectedTopic] = useState();

  function handleSelect(selectedButton) {
    setSelectedTopic(selectedButton);
    console.log(selectedTopic); // current state, not updated state value
  }

  // jsx - JS file that uses non-standard JS syntax

  console.log("APP COMPONENT EXECUTING");

  let tabContent = <p>Please select a topic.</p>;

  if (selectedTopic) {
    tabContent = (
      <div id="tab-content">
        <h3>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].title}</h3>
        <p>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].description}</p>
        <pre>
          <code>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].code}</code>
        </pre>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    // html code inside JavaScript
    <div>
      {/* we can use component like HTML element */}
      <Header />
      <main>
        <section id="core-concepts">
          <h2>Time to get started!</h2>
          <ul>
            <CoreConcept
              title={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].title}
              description={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].description}
              image={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].image}
            />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[1]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[2]} />
            <CoreConcept {...CORE_CONCEPTS[3]} />
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="examples">
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <menu>
            {/* arrow function is the value passed as a value to onSelect, also to onClick in TapButton.jsx*/}
            {/* this function will be executed when the button is clicked */}
            {/* now we can control how it will be executed */}
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("components")}>
              Components
            </TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("jsx")}>JSX</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("props")}>Props</TapButton>
            <TapButton onSelect={() => handleSelect("state")}>State</TapButton>
          </menu>
          {tabContent}
        </section>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Outputting list data dynamically

- JSX is capable of dealing with arrays of renderable data
- function inside map function will be executed by JS for every item in that array
- inside that function, we can return the code we wanna transform that item
- must be used with key prop
- the value for key prop should be a value that uniquely identifies a list item

```jsx
<ul>
  {CORE_CONCEPTS.map((conceptItem) => (
    <CoreConcept key={conceptItem.title} {...conceptItem} />
  ))}
</ul>
```
